-- 3) coordinator combines stats received from segments to overwrite the stats of its own.
-- Because upstream introduced a feature which could skip full index scan uring cleanup
-- of B-tree indexes when possible (refer to:
-- https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/857f9c36cda520030381bd8c2af20adf0ce0e1d4),
-- there was a case in QD-QEs distributed deployment that some QEs could skip full index scan and
-- stop updating statistics, result in QD being unable to collect all QEs' stats thus overwrote
-- a paritial accumulated value to index->reltuples. More interesting, it usually happened starting
-- from the 3rd time of consecutively VACUUM after fresh inserts due to above skipping index scan
-- criteria.
